                    <p>My fascination with technology has always been driven by a desire to understand how things work.
                        Quite early on, this lead to me to experiment with electronics and little arduino projects. But
                        just as much as I enjoyed technology, I was drawn to visual arts, cinema and music. I’ve played
                        and instrument for the majority of my life and I’ve always been fascinated by movies and
                        filmmaking. During my highschool years, I gradually switched from moving image to photography
                        and spent much of my free time exploring Munich with a camera. I also developed a lasting
                        passion for analog photography, and started experimenting with different processes and printing
                        techniques.

                    <p>
                        After graduating, I was torn between pursuing my artistic interests or taking a
                        more technical path. I eventually decided to strike a balance between the two by studying
                        Computer Science in a dual studies
                        program with cinema camera manufacturer <a href="https://www.arri.com/en"
                            target="_blank">ARRI</a>. Though I
                        never really considered a degree in “pure” computer science, I ended up really enjoying the deep
                        understanding it gave me about mathematical and theoretical concepts — especially when subjects
                        intersected with the “real world”, like in signal theory, mathematical modeling or the

                    <p>
                        At ARRI, I had the chance to go through several departments, including Camera Service, Project-
                        / Quality
                        Management, and Camera R&D, before joining the then newly formed Solutions department. This
                        team focused on developing new production workflows in response to the rapid technological
                        advancements in the industry. The small initiative operated much like an experimental R&D Lab,
                        and I
                        really enjoyed its hands-on prototyping approach, especially compared to the more traditionally
                        structured departments I had worked in before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main responsibility within Solutions was developing a software application for color
                        calibration in virtual
                        production studios. The goal was to create a semi-automated workflow by integrating camera
                        communication through an IP interface, enabling automatic setting adjustments and image
                        captures. While my initial role was UI development, I gradually took on additional tasks,
                        including implementing the IP interface, refining the backend calibration algorithm, and
                        deploying the final application. The application was originally only compatible with
                        ARRI
                        cameras, but I later expanded the workflow into a universal calibration system as part of my

                    <p>For a long time, I wasn’t quite sure where I fit between art and science. While choosing a more
                        technical path for my bachelor’s degree ultimately felt like the right decision, I often found
                        myself envious of the things my creative peers would do, feeling like I’m wasting my time on
                        mathematics and theory. At some point this changed, and I started two realize (1) what an
                        amazing toolset my IT studies gave me to pursue creative work and (2) how exciting it is when
                        the two worlds overlap. Once I leaned into that intersection, I discovered so many fascinating
                        applications and met more and more people who shared the same combined passion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking back, I think one reason I struggled to find my place was because I kept thinking in
                        terms of fixed disciplines rather than interests. I’ve always loved problem-solving and
                        designing experiences, but that interest has never been limited to programming. Same
                        goes for my artistic work, which has always revolved around human interactions and visual
                        patterns, even if the medium I use to express them keeps shifting. This non-disciplinary way of
                        thinking was a real revelation for me, and also made me realize how similar the two fields
                        really are.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="chapter-text third">
                    <p>Recently, I also started exploring theoretical perspectives on the subject, like the wonderfuI
                        book “The
                        new landscape in
                        art and science” by Gyorgy Kepes, who argues that the two fields are inherently
                        interconnected. Kepes emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary work, considering the “new
                        landscape” of a world shaped by technology and science. Even though he wrote this book in the
                        1950s,
                        long before many of the innovations that define our current society, his ideas feel more
                        relevant than
                        ever. </p>
                    <p>
                        Another concept I often revisit is Kurzweils theory of the “technological singularity”, which I
                        covered in a thesis a few years ago. He proposes that the speed of all human innovation
                        accelerates exponentially, leading to a point of infinitely rapid development in the near future
                        — driven by AI and eventually AGI. Even though I would nowadays consider his approach too
                        technology-driven and idealistic, the general model feels quite fitting. It’s a reminder of how
                        urgently we need to think not only about what’s possible, but about what’s right.

                        <p>As a follow-up to my work in the Solutions Department at ARRI, my bachelor’s thesis also
                            focused on color calibration for Virtual Production studios. Based on an existing
                            proprietary approach and additional scientific research, I developed a camera-agnostic
                            workflow that
                            enables calibration across a wide range of camera setups and system configurations. Next to
                            the calibration algorithm, I also implemented a verification workflow, designed an
                            accompanying user interface, and conducted
                            extensive testing across diverse camera models and production conditions to ensure
                            robustness and accuracy. I really enjoyed working with color because it combines quite a
                            complex scientific problem with simple perceptual intuition. You can immediately tell when
                            an image is calibrated correctly
                            because it just looks pleasing, but at the same time, there’s an underlying mathematical
                            framework that explains exactly why. <br><br>Find the entire thesis <a

                        <p>In the final semester of my bachelor’s degree, I took part in the AICA project workshop — an
                            interdisciplinary initiative led by multiple Munich universities to address challenges at
                            the intersection of AI, culture, and the arts. In a team of four, we developed an
                            interactive art installation exploring feedback loops in generative AI models, paying homage
                            to a musical piece by Alvin Lucier. I was mainly responsible for the technical development,
                            from setting up a local StableDiffusion model and designing prompts to writing the control
                            script and building the hardware interface using an ESP32. Despite the tight timeframe, this
                            project showed me how rewarding it is to collaborate with people from different disciplines
                            — and unexpectedly, it also taught me a lot about woodworking and processing metal.

                        <p> Although my photographic journey originally started on Instagram, I found myself losing
                            interest in the platform in recent years. At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed exploring
                            user interaction and rethinking interfaces. So, I eventually decided to create my own
                            personal website to
                            showcase my photography. I wanted to keep the aspects I liked about social media (image
                            grid, chronological feed, minimal metadata) while removing all the clutter around it.
                            Inspired by archival projects and novel content platforms like
                            Are.na, I ended up with a very minimal, image-centric layout, which I implemented from
                            scratch using PHP and a basic folder-based CMS solution.

                            dream images. The original idea was to visualize these concepts using photography, capturing
                            everyday moments that evoke a sense of surrealism, as if they were part of a dream. On a
                            less metaphorical level, it became a way for me to disconnect during stressful times -
                            grabbing my camera and following wherever my intuition led me. My plan is to eventually
                            turn these into a printed zine, I just haven’t found the time to do it.

                    <p>I often come back to a thesis I wrote in highschool about Kurzweils theory of the technological
                        singularity. He proposes that the speed of all human innovation accelerates exponentially,
                        leading to a point of infinitely rapid development in the near future — driven by AI and
                        eventually AGI. Even though I would nowadays consider his approach too technology-driven and
                        idealistic, the general model feels quite fitting in a world where innovation already seems to
                        outpace our ability to process it. I see it as a reminder of how urgently we need to think not
                        only
                        about what’s possible, but about what’s right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, I would love to explore these questions in a collaborative, interdisciplinary
                        environment like the Design&Computation Master.
                        I've been following the program for a while now, and I'm constantly amazed by the project
                        output.
                        I also really loved the spirit I experienced when visiting for the Info Event and left feeling
                        genuinely excited about the chance to work with such a diverse and skilled group.

                    <p> As established before, I really believe in the interdisciplinary approach and I think my
                        technical knowledge and creative background would be a nice addition to the team. </p>
